          <p>(Well I guess we sort of do)</p>
          <p>But he is objectively a loser.</p>
          <p>He's stood for election as a member of parliament 7 times since 1994, and lost every single time.</p>
          <p>He is tenacious though, and has been instrumental in bringing about an incredibly destructive and damaging Brexit with his 'Brexit Party'.</p>
          <p>Now he's looking to rebrand as 'Reform UK', so he can oppose coronavirus lockdown measures and somehow throw in some xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiments.</p>
          <p>We can't quite work out how that's reform...</p>
          <p>Anyway, just as he did when he set up the Brexit Party, he hasn't done very well at buying the domain names.</p>
          <p>Last time the legendary <a href="https://twitter.com/ByDonkeys?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank">Led By Donkeys</a> bought <a href="thebrexitparty.com" target="_blank">thebrexitparty.com</a>, so Farage tried to sue them unsuccessfully... using EU laws!</p>
          <p>So this time we thought we'd get in on the fun and buy a few domains...</p>
